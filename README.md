# ArcGIS Maps SDKs for Native Apps: Real-Time

The Native Maps SDKs now include a new Dynamic Entities API that provides a framework for visualizing, processing, and analyzing real-time data feeds in your native apps. This session will cover how to use the API to ingest data from ArcGIS Stream Services and custom feeds, work with the data as Dynamic Entities, and visualize it in maps and scenes. This includes the ability to interact with Dynamic Entities on the map through identify and select, as well as enable automated behaviors that track updates to dynamic entities in 2D and 3D.
